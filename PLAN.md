## Development Plan: Local-Only DNA Research Tool

**Goal:** Build a privacy-first genomic research tool where user data never leaves their control, powered by a "Data Lakehouse" architecture using DuckDB WASM and Parquet.

**Core Philosophy:**

1. **Privacy:** User DNA is processed locally. It is never uploaded to external servers.
2. **Performance:** Range requests fetch only necessary genomic data.
3. **Flexibility:** Multiple deployment modes (browser-only, hybrid server, containerized).
4. **Open Source:** Engine is open, data curation can be monetized.

## 🔬 Phase 6.5: Imputation System (NEW)

**Objective:** Dramatically improve PGS coverage through local LD-based imputation.

### Problem

DTC DNA tests (23andMe, AncestryDNA) only genotype ~600K variants, but PGS often require millions. This results in:

- 1-5% coverage on many PGS scores
- Unreliable risk calculations
- Quality penalties that can't compensate for missing data

### Solution

Pre-computed reference panels from 1000 Genomes that enable local imputation:

- **Coverage improvement**: 1-5% → 60-80%
- **Privacy-preserving**: All processing local, no external APIs
- **Efficient**: 2-8GB reference panels vs 100GB+ full imputation
- **Fast**: ~30-60s in browser, ~5-10s on server

### Implementation Status

- [x] Design imputation architecture (see `docs/IMPUTATION_STRATEGY.md`)
- [x] Create reference panel builder (`packages/pipeline/build-imputation-panel.js`)
- [x] Create imputation engine (`packages/core/src/imputation/local-imputer.js`)
- [ ] Download and process 1000 Genomes data
- [ ] Build reference panels for EUR population
- [ ] Integrate with genomic processor
- [ ] Add UI toggle for imputation
- [ ] Test coverage improvements on real PGS
- [ ] Optimize performance and storage
- [ ] Add multi-ancestry support (AFR, EAS, SAS, AMR)

### Usage

```bash
# Build reference panel for chromosome 22 (testing)
pnpm impute:build --chr 22 --population EUR --maf 0.01

# Build full reference panel (all chromosomes)
for chr in {1..22}; do
  pnpm impute:build --chr $chr --population EUR
done
```

### Expected Impact

- **Before**: PGS with 530K variants → 8K matched (1.5%) → Quality score: 28 (poor)
- **After**: PGS with 530K variants → 350K matched (66%) → Quality score: 75 (good)
