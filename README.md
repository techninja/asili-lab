# Asili

_Swahili for "Root"_ - Your personal family genomic risk assistant that never owns your data.

## Overview

Asili is a privacy-first genomic risk analysis platform that processes DNA data entirely on your own hardware. Built on IndexedDB and DuckDB WASM architecture, it ensures your genetic information never leaves your control while providing comprehensive polygenic risk score (PGS) calculations.

## Current Architecture

### Browser-Based SPA (v1.0)

- **Frontend**: Web Components + DuckDB WASM
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for user data, DuckDB for genomic datasets
- **Processing**: Client-side JavaScript with WASM acceleration
- **Data**: Parquet files served via HTTP Range Requests
- **Privacy**: Zero-knowledge - all processing happens locally

### Deployment Options

1. **Static Hosting**: Deploy to any CDN (S3, Netlify, Vercel)
2. **Local Docker**: Single-container deployment for home servers
3. **Development**: Docker Compose with pipeline, CDN, and webapp

## Features

- **Multi-format DNA Support**: 23andMe, AncestryDNA, MyHeritage, and more
- **Family Genomics**: Manage multiple individuals with separate profiles
- **Comprehensive Traits**: 100+ polygenic risk scores from PGS Catalog
- **Genotype Imputation**: Beagle 5.4 imputation with TOPMed panel (60-80% coverage)
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket-based progress tracking
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Browser-only or server-assisted processing
- **Cache Management**: Export/import results for backup and sharing
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Smooth performance with large trait lists

## Deployment Options

### ETL Pipeline

```bash
# Interactive menu
pnpm etl

# Run locally (faster)
pnpm etl local

# Run in Docker (uses gnomAD if GNOMAD_DB_PATH set in .env)
pnpm etl docker
```

### Imputation Setup

```bash
# Setup Beagle + 1000 Genomes (9GB, 2.2% coverage)
pnpm imputation setup

# Upgrade to TOPMed (150GB, 60-80% coverage) - Recommended
pnpm imputation setup-topmed

# Impute user DNA
pnpm imputation impute
```

See [docs/IMPUTATION.md](docs/IMPUTATION.md) for detailed imputation guide.

### Single Command Deployment

```bash
# Start webapp (hybrid mode with server-side processing)
docker compose up -d
# Access at http://localhost:4242
```

### Pipeline Processing

```bash
# Run ETL pipeline
docker compose run --rm pipeline pnpm run etl

# Or use the helper script
pnpm run etl
```

- **Security Tests**: Privacy compliance and vulnerability scanning
- **Cross-Platform Tests**: Validation across browser, mobile, and server

## License

AGPLv3 License - See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

**Why AGPLv3?**

- Prevents proprietary forks - anyone who modifies Asili must share their changes
- Network copyleft - if you run a modified version as a web service, you must provide source code
- Protects the community - ensures improvements benefit everyone
- Commercial use allowed - you can charge for services, but must keep code open source

**What this means:**

- ✅ Use Asili freely for personal or commercial purposes
- ✅ Modify and improve the code
- ✅ Run it as a service for others
- ❌ Create a proprietary closed-source version
- ❌ Hide your modifications from users

## Privacy Statement

Asili is designed with privacy as the foundational principle:

- **No Data Collection**: We never see, store, or transmit your genomic data
- **Local Processing**: All analysis happens on your own hardware
- **Open Source**: Full transparency in how your data is processed
- **User Control**: You own and control all data and results

Your DNA data is yours alone. Asili simply provides the tools to analyze it privately.
